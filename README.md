This is the unrealircd-contrib repository. It makes it easy to 
install 3rd party modules in UnrealIRCd 5 on *NIX.

Note that 3rd party modules are NOT written by the UnrealIRCd team.
Use these modules at your own risk. In case of problems, contact
the author of the module.

## For end-users
Use the [UnrealIRCd 5 module manager](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Module_manager)
to list and (un)install modules, eg:
* ./unrealircd modules list
* ./unrealircd modules install third/something

## For module coders
If you are a module coder and want to add your module to this repository
as well, then read the rules and procedure at:
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Rules_for_3rd_party_modules_in_unrealircd-contrib
